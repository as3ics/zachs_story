Everything written in this memoir is based on the objective truth as I perceived it at that time it happened. Interpretations of what I have perceived have changed over time, and this will be reflected by the dates of each entry. This is particularly true for the prelude, where events that felt like obvious "signs" at the time were later realized to be common human reactions to uncommon situations.

Some names have been changed; some have not.

All statements are facts; but some may be ommited.

Many entries may be shocking or upsetting, others may be revelations.

All I am trying to do in this memoir is get you to ask yourself:

    Is it chance?
