Everything written in this collection is the objective truth as I interpreted it at that time. Interpretations of what have happened have changed over time, and they will be reflected in the entries. This is true particularly for the prelude, where events that felt like obvious "signs" at the time I later realized were common human reactions to uncommon situations, and this has come the knowledge gained on the journey of life.

Some names have been changed; some have not.

All statements are facts; but some may be ommited.

Many entries may be shocking or upsetting, others will hopefully be revelations.

What I objectively trying to get you to do throughout this memoir is ask yourself:

Is it chance?
